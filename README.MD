### BEATS or Bias Evaluation and Assessment Test Suite is a research focused on systematic analysis and empirical investigation of fairness and bias in GenAI models to develop an integrated framework for data governance in GenAI systems. 

#### This research covers: 

- **Measuring and detecting bias and fairness.** 

- **Develop metrics for assessing the ethical implications of training datasets.** 

- **Establish practical guidelines for data governance in AI development.**

- **Propose mechanisms for reducing bias and increasing fairness in AI models.**
